## Restick is my porfolio project for this autumn.

### I'm applying my knowledge of Node.js and Vue.js to create a modern single page application for effective learning structures, such as spaced repetition. This webapp is inspired by the book "Make It Stick: The Science of Successful Learning". I will also be trying on MongoDB and Google OAuth for this project.
